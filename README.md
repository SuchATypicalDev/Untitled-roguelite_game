# introduction
this is a hobby project by me -SuchATypicalDev- which is intended to be a base or reference for people who would like a kickstart in game development using the godot engine
# disclaimer
this project is in no way a proper guide for safe/secure/performant code and im not responsible in any way for any trouble this project may cause including but not limited to unpatched vulnerabilities and outdated code practices
# dependencies
currently there are no dependencies just import the porject using godot.
# how to install 
1-download godot (the porject uses godot v4.5.1 stable downgrading or upgrading may cause unexpected behaviour, do it on your own risk)

2-clone the repo to a folder on your file system and name it whatever you want

3-use godot to import a project from the directory that you cloned into

ex. you cloned the game into a directory called MYGAME, in that case click on the import button on godot, then navigate into the directory MYGAME and then click "select current folder".
